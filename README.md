# NewsApp
Newsreader app is an application in Kotlin that reads a news API and shows articles in a Recycler View.
The detail page of each article is available. 
The user can register and login to have access to the favorites functionality.
After logging in, the user can mark an article as "liked" or "disliked" and see the list of favorites articles.
That is my first application in Kotlin.
